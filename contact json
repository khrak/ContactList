    "about":"Jon Snow is the bastard Son of Lord Ned Stark by an unknown mother.\n\n Although he lives with his father, Jon does not know the identity of his mother since Ned has refused to admit her name to anyone, though he told King Robert Baratheon that her name was Wylla, a servant in the employ of House Dayne of Dorne.\n\n Ned raised Jon alongside his natural born sons Robb, Bran, and Rickon, but Ned's wife Catelyn has always resented him and treated him with disdain and Jon has always felt like an outsider, never really part of the family. Ned's daughter Arya, however, is close to Jon and he gives her a sword named Needle.\n\n When Ned leaves King's Landing to become Hand of the King for Robert Baratheron, Jon decides to join the Night's Watch. It is here that the skills that were passed on to him by Ned come to light as Jon becomes a natural born leader with a strong code of ethics and an effective warrior when battling at and beyond the Wall."

    "about":"Daenerys is the only daughter of Aerys II Targaryen and Rhaella Targaryen.\n\nShe is now a princess living in exile, the last of the Targaryens.\n\n Daenerys was born in the closing days of Robert's Rebellion after her father, \"the mad king\" had already been killed. Rhaella and her son Viserys, were evacuated to Dragonstone shortly before Aerys's death, where Rhaella gave birth to Daenerys in the midst of a violent storm that destroyed the remnants of the Targaryen fleet, leading to her moniker, Daenerys Stormborn. Her mother died giving birth.\n\n Daenerys and Viserys were saved from capture by Ser Willem Darry and four other loyal men who were able to spirit them away to Braavos. Ser Willem looked after the children until he died several years later, and they were forced out into the streets. They wandered from city to city, ending up in Pentos, where Illyrio Mopatis took them in.\n\n Although timid and unsure of herself at first Daenerys grows into a supremely confident warrior women with perhaps the most stringent code of ethics in all the Seven Kingdoms.\n\n She believes she is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne and is on a mission to reclaim it."

    "about":"Cersei is the daughter of Lord Tywin Lannister, the richest man in all of Westeros and the late Joanna Lannister. She is the wife of King Robert Baratheon and as such is the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\n She is twin sister to Jaime, with whom she maintains a very close relationship. She is elder sister to Tyrion for whom she only has disdain because he is a dwarf and their mother died giving birth to him.\n\n Cersei is beautiful, cunning, and ambitious. She is wife to Robert Baratheon in name only, seeking affection elsewhere, but relishes her role as queen. She is fiercely protective of her children Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen and is not above taking down others in order to elevate them and the Lannister name.\n\n In addition to her ruthlessness, Cersei is also quite funny, with a cutting and quick sense of humor.\n\n Because Tywin was often away from their home at Casterly Rock serving as Hand to the King when she was young, Cersei, Jaime, and Tyrion were primarily raised by servants."

He is an avid reader, a good cook, and can be resourceful in his mind if not quick on his feet. He becomes a close friend and confidant to fellow \"crow\" Jon Snow."
